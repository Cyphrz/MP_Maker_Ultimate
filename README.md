# MP_Maker_Ultimate
Improved vanilla firmware for the Wanhao Duplicator6/Monoprice Maker Ultimate

The goal of this project is to update the firmware to be inline with the latest Ultimaker Firmware and very small improvements.

Improvements include 
Better PID to prevent overshoot
Max Temp of 275 vs the stock 250 (DO NOT GO OVER 250 WITH THE STOCK HOTEND)
